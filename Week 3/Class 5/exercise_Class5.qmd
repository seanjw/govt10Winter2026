b) Creates new columns or modifies existing ones
c) Filters rows based on conditions
d) Sorts data by a variable

Answer: _____

### 1.2 Code Detective: Basic mutate()

What does this code create?

```r
data %>%
  mutate(
    vote_margin = dem_votes - rep_votes,
    winner = if_else(vote_margin > 0, "Democrat", "Republican")
  )
```

Line 3 creates: _____
Line 4 creates: _____

2. _____ text variables into categories
3. Create _____ (TRUE/FALSE) indicators
4. Convert between _____ types
5. Handle _____ values appropriately

Word bank: differences, recode, logical, data, missing

## 2. Conditional Logic

### 2.1 Match: if_else() vs case_when()

Match each function with when to use it:

**Functions:**
a) if_else()
b) case_when()

**Use cases:**
1. Creating a variable with only two possible outcomes
2. Creating a variable with multiple categories
3. Simple yes/no binary coding
4. Complex multi-condition logic

Matches: a = _____ and _____, b = _____ and _____

### 2.2 Code Detective: case_when()

What categories does this code create?

```r
data %>%
  mutate(
    age_group = case_when(
      age < 30 ~ "Young",
      age < 50 ~ "Middle",
      age < 65 ~ "Older",
      TRUE ~ "Senior"
    )
  )
```

For someone age 25: _____
For someone age 45: _____
For someone age 70: _____

### 2.3 Spot the Error

What's wrong with this case_when() statement?

```r
mutate(
  income_cat = case_when(
    income < 30000 ~ "Low",
    income < 50000 ~ "Medium",
    income < 30000 ~ "Low",
    TRUE ~ "High"
  )
)
```

Problem: _____

## 3. Working with Proportions

### 3.1 Multiple Choice: Calculating Proportions

To calculate the proportion of Democrats in a dataset, you would:

a) Count Democrats and divide by Republicans
b) Count Democrats and divide by total observations
c) Count total and divide by Democrats
d) Use mean() on a logical variable

Answer: _____

### 3.2 True or False: summarise()

Mark each statement as True (T) or False (F):

_____ summarise() reduces multiple rows to a single summary row
_____ You can calculate multiple statistics in one summarise() call
_____ summarise() automatically groups by all variables
_____ n() counts the number of rows in each group
_____ summarise() can only calculate numeric summaries

### 3.3 Fill in the Code

Complete this code to calculate turnout rate:

```r
data %>%
  summarise(
    total_voters = _____,
    total_voted = sum(_____ == "Yes"),
    turnout_rate = _____ / _____
  )
```

## 4. Advanced Transformations

### 4.1 Match: Functions and Purposes

Match each function with its purpose:

**Functions:**
a) round()
b) log()
c) sqrt()
d) abs()
e) lag()

**Purposes:**
1. Remove decimal places
2. Transform skewed data
3. Calculate square root
4. Make negative values positive
5. Get previous row's value

Matches: a = _____, b = _____, c = _____, d = _____, e = _____

### 4.2 Code Detective: Complex Transformation

What does this code calculate?

```r
data %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  mutate(
    state_avg = mean(income, na.rm = TRUE),
    income_diff = income - state_avg,
    above_avg = income_diff > 0
  )
```

This code calculates: _____

# AI Exercises

**Tips for Working with Claude:**

- Ask for **R code using only tidyverse** (no other packages)
- Request **simple, focused answers** to your specific question—not complex analyses
- Ask Claude to **explain what the code is doing** since you're learning
- Avoid asking for visualizations or plots in these exercises
- Include the output of `glimpse()` in your prompt so Claude knows your variable names

**Example prompt:** "Using tidyverse in R, create a new variable called ideology_category using case_when() that categorizes ideology_score into 'left', 'center', and 'right' based on terciles. Keep the code simple and explain what each line does. Here is what my data looks like: [paste glimpse output]"

For each AI exercise:
- Work with Claude to analyze the data
- Record your prompts and key findings

## 5. Creating Political Variables

**Dataset: legislative_votes.csv**

**Description**: Roll call voting data with legislator information.

**Variables**:
- `legislator_id`: Unique identifier (int)
- `name`: Legislator name (chr)
- `party`: Political party (chr)
- `state`: State abbreviation (chr)
- `district`: District number (int)
- `ideology_score`: -1 (liberal) to 1 (conservative) (dbl)
