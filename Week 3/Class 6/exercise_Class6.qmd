Complete this code to analyze panel data:

```r
panel_data %>%
  group_by(_____) %>%  # Group by individual

  mutate(
    income_change = income - lag(_____)
  )
```

### 3.3 Spot the Error: Research Design

What's wrong with this conclusion?

4. Confounding

Matches: a = _____, b = _____, c = _____, d = _____

### 4.3 True or False: Research Tradeoffs

Mark each statement as True (T) or False (F):

_____ Lab experiments have high internal validity but may lack realism
_____ Natural experiments always have perfect random assignment
_____ Large samples guarantee causal inference
_____ Field experiments balance control and realism
_____ Observational studies are always inferior to experiments

# AI Exercises

**Tips for Working with Claude:**

- Ask for **R code using only tidyverse** (no other packages)
- Request **simple, focused answers** to your specific question—not complex analyses
- Ask Claude to **explain what the code is doing** since you're learning
- Avoid asking for visualizations or plots in these exercises
- Include the output of `glimpse()` in your prompt so Claude knows your variable names

**Example prompt:** "Using tidyverse in R, compare the mean poverty rate between counties where wage_change is TRUE vs FALSE. Keep the code simple and explain what each line does. Here is what my data looks like: [paste glimpse output]"

For each AI exercise:
- Work with Claude to analyze the data
- Record your prompts and key findings
