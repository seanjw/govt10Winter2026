# Non-AI Exercises

## 1. Understanding Measures of Central Tendency

### 1.1 Multiple Choice: Mean vs Median

a) When you want the most precise calculation
b) When the data has extreme outliers or is skewed
c) When all values are the same
d) When you have categorical data

Answer: _____

### 1.2 Fill in the Blanks: Central Tendency

1. The _____ is the sum of all values divided by the count
2. The _____ is the middle value when data is ordered
3. The _____ is the most frequently occurring value
4. When data is skewed right, the mean is typically _____ than the median
5. The _____ is most affected by outliers

Word bank: mean, median, mode, greater, less

### 1.3 Code Detective: Grouped Summaries

What does this code calculate?

  )
```

This code calculates: _____

## 2. Measures of Spread

### 2.1 Match: Measures of Spread

Match each measure with its definition:

**Measures:**
a) Range
b) Variance
c) Standard deviation
d) Interquartile range (IQR)

**Definitions:**
1. Square root of the variance
2. Maximum value minus minimum value
3. Average squared deviation from the mean
4. Distance between 25th and 75th percentiles

Matches: a = _____, b = _____, c = _____, d = _____

### 2.2 Multiple Choice: Standard Deviation

a) 50%
b) 68%
c) 95%
d) 99%

Answer: _____ (Hint: Think about the empirical rule)

### 2.3 True or False: Spread

Mark each statement as True (T) or False (F):

_____ Variance is always positive or zero
_____ Standard deviation has the same units as the original data
_____ A larger standard deviation means data is more spread out
_____ The range is affected by outliers
_____ IQR is more robust to outliers than standard deviation

## 3. The `summarise()` Function

### 3.1 Fill in the Code: summarise()

Complete this code to calculate mean, median, and standard deviation:

```r
approval %>%
  summarise(
    mean_approval = _____(congress_approval, na.rm = TRUE),
    median_approval = _____(congress_approval, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_approval = _____(congress_approval, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```

Functions needed: mean, median, sd

### 3.2 Multiple Choice: NA Values

What happens when you run `mean(c(1, 2, NA, 4))`?

a) Returns 2.33 (ignores the NA)
b) Returns NA
c) Gives an error
d) Returns 2 (treats NA as 0)

Answer: _____

## 4. Real-World Applications

### 4.1 Match: Statistical Concepts

Match polling concepts with statistical terms:

**Polling Terms:**
a) Margin of error
b) Sample size
c) Confidence level
d) Poll average

**Statistical Terms:**
1. Mean of multiple measurements
2. Number of observations (n)
3. Related to standard error
4. Probability of capturing true value

Matches: a = _____, b = _____, c = _____, d = _____

### 4.2 Code Detective: Real Analysis

What question does this code answer?

```r
approval %>%
  group_by(party_id, region) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_approval = mean(congress_approval, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_approval = sd(congress_approval, na.rm = TRUE),
    count = n()
  )
```

This analysis shows: _____

# AI Exercises

**Tips for Working with Claude:**

- Ask for **R code using only tidyverse** (no other packages)
- Request **simple, focused answers** to your specific question—not complex analyses
- Ask Claude to **explain what the code is doing** since you're learning
- Avoid asking for visualizations or plots in these exercises
- Include the output of `glimpse()` in your prompt so Claude knows your variable names

**Example prompt:** "Using tidyverse in R, calculate the mean and standard deviation of congress_approval by party_id. Keep the code simple and explain what each line does. Here is what my data looks like: [paste glimpse output]"

## 5. Congressional Approval Analysis

**Dataset: congressional_approval.csv**

**Description**: Survey data on congressional approval ratings with demographics.

**Variables**:
- `respondent_id`: Unique identifier (int)
- `age`: Respondent's age (int)
- `education`: Education level (chr)
- `party_id`: Democrat, Republican, Independent (chr)
- `income_category`: Income bracket (chr)
- `region`: Geographic region (chr)
- `congress_approval`: Approval rating for Congress, 0-100 scale (dbl)

### 5.1 Initial Data Exploration

```{r}
# Load the dataset
library(tidyverse)
approval <- read_csv("congressional_approval.csv")

# Examine the data
glimpse(approval)
summary(approval$congress_approval)
```

Use Claude to calculate and interpret basic summary statistics for congressional approval ratings.

### 5.2 Approval by Party

Work with Claude to calculate mean and median approval ratings by party affiliation. What patterns do you observe? Are there differences in how spread out opinions are within each party?

### 5.3 Regional Variations

Ask Claude to help you explore how congressional approval varies by region. Which regions show the highest and lowest approval? Which have the most consensus (lowest standard deviation)?

### 5.4 Creating a Summary Report

Work with Claude to create a comprehensive summary table that shows approval statistics by both party and region. What insights emerge from this analysis?
